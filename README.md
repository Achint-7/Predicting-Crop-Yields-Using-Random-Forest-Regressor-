# Predicting-Crop-Yields-Using-Random-Forest-Regressor-
This project uses Python and Machine Learning (Random Forest Regressor) to predict crop yields based on agricultural data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and is implemented in Google Colab with the code and dataset hosted on GitHub.
