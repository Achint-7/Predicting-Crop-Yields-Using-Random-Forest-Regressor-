# Predicting Crop Yields In India Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project uses Python and Machine Learning to predict crop yields based on various agricultural factors. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict crop yields, which could be a valuable tool for farmers, agricultural scientists, and policy makers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about different crops, their cultivation area, production, annual rainfall, and other relevant details. It includes over 19,000+ rows and 10 columns.

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Google Colab using Python. The machine learning model used is the Random Forest Regressor. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Steps
1. Import necessary libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Preprocess the data
4. Split the data into training and testing sets
5. Train the Random Forest Regressor model
6. Evaluate the model
7. Save the model for future use

## Results
The trained model can predict crop yields with a certain level of accuracy (you can fill in the exact accuracy after you've evaluated your model).

## Future Work
Future work could involve trying different machine learning models, tuning the model's hyperparameters to achieve better performance, or using more complex features for training the model.
